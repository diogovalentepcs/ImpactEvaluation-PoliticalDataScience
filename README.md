# Impact Evaluation Project 
This is an academic project for a course on Political Data Analyisis (PUC Chile Aug 2022 - Dec 2022)

Project available as a blog here: https://diogovalentepcs.github.io/ImpactEvaluation-PoliticalDataScience/_site/index.html

In this project, I evaluate the Environmental Impact (car use) of the implementation of shared bicycles product in Santiago de Chile. This evaluation is highly based on "The effect of transport policies on car use: Evidence from Latin American cities" by Francisco Gallego, Juan-Pablo Montero and Christian Salas.
